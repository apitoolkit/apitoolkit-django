# API Toolkit Python Django SDK

The API Toolkit django client is an sdk used to integrate django web applications with APIToolkit.
It monitors incoming traffic, gathers the requests and sends the request to the apitoolkit servers.

## How to Integrate:

First install the apitoolkit django sdk:
`pip install apitoolkit-django`

Add your APIToolkit API key (APITOOLKIT_KEY) to your django settings:

```python
APITOOLKIT_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

Then add apitoolkit middleware into the settings middleware list:

```python

MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...,
    'apitoolkit_django.APIToolkit',
    ...,
]

```

This will monitor all requests and send them to the APIToolkit's servers.

## Client Redacting fields

While it's possible to mark a field as redacted from the apitoolkit dashboard, this client also supports redacting at the client side.
Client side redacting means that those fields would never leave your servers at all. So you feel safer that your sensitive data only stays on your servers.

To mark fields that should be redacted, add them to your application's settings.
Eg:

```python
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_HEADERS = ["Authorization", "Cookie","Content-Length", "Content-Type"]
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_REQ_BODY = ["$.password", "$.credit_card"]
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_RES_BODY = ["$.credentials", "$.social_security_number"]
```

It is important to note that while the `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_HEADERS` config field accepts a list of headers(case insensitive),
the `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_REQ_BODY` and `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_RES_BODY` expect a list of JSONPath strings as arguments.

The choice of JSONPath was selected to allow you have great flexibility in descibing which fields within your responses are sensitive.
Also note that these list of items to be redacted will be aplied to all endpoint requests and responses on your server.

## Debugging

You can add `APITOOLKIT_DEBUG` to your app settings file and set it to `True` to enable debug logging from the SDK. This will print out logs for each request/response captured by the middleware. APITOOLKIT_DEBUG defaults to `False`.

Eg:

```python

APITOOLKIT_DEBUG = True

```
